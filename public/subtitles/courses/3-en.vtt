Understanding composition is crucial for creating compelling illustrations.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Composition is how you arrange elements within your artwork

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to guide the viewer's eye and create visual impact.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
There are several fundamental principles that will help you

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
create more dynamic and engaging illustrations. The rule of thirds

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
is one of the most important compositional tools for artists.

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
By dividing your canvas into nine equal sections, you can

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
place important elements along these lines for better balance.

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Leading lines help direct the viewer's attention to focal points,

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
while contrast creates hierarchy and visual interest. Understanding

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
these principles will transform your illustration skills dramatically.

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
In this lesson, we'll explore practical composition techniques

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
that professional illustrators use every day. You'll learn

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
how to create depth, balance, and visual flow in your artwork.

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We'll also cover common composition mistakes to avoid

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and how to fix them when they occur in your work.
