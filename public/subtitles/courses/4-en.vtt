00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Understanding perspective and depth is essential for creating

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
believable three-dimensional illustrations on a flat surface.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Perspective gives your artwork the illusion of depth and space,

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
making your illustrations more immersive and realistic.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
There are several types of perspective you need to master.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
One-point perspective is perfect for creating depth in simple scenes,

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
while two-point perspective adds complexity and realism

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
to architectural and environmental illustrations. Three-point

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
perspective creates dramatic viewpoints from above or below.

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Understanding atmospheric perspective will help you create

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
convincing distance in landscapes and large-scale illustrations.

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We'll also explore foreshortening techniques and how

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
to use overlapping elements to suggest depth. These skills

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
are fundamental for character design, environment art,

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and architectural visualization. By the end of this lesson,

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
you'll have the tools to create convincing spatial relationships

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
in all your illustration work. Let's dive into perspective.
