00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's start with the colors and the psychology of color. Why is color

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
important to us and why do we talk about it at all? Colors play

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
a very important role in our lives whether we realize it or not.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
They have the ability to affect our emotions and moods towards

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the environment, characters, and the objects in a way that few

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
other things can. Color is a very important tool for communicating

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and can be used to indicate action, affect the mood, and cause

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
reactions in people's mind. Some colors can actually raise your

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
blood pressure, increase metabolism, and have been known to cause

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
eye strain if you look at them for too long. With colors, you can

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
set the mood, attract attention, or make a statement. You can use

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
color to energize or calm down. By selecting the right color scheme,

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
you can create the ambiance of elegance, warmth, or tranquility.

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Different colors evoke different emotional responses and understanding

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
these responses will help you become a more effective

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
digital artist and illustrator. Color theory is fundamental

17
