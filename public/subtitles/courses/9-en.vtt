00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Visual storytelling is the heart of compelling illustration.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Every element in your artwork should contribute to the narrative

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
you want to communicate. Strong storytelling transcends

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
technical skill and creates emotional connections with viewers.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Body language and facial expressions convey character emotions

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and relationships without words. Environmental storytelling

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
uses setting details to suggest backstory and context.

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Color psychology supports your narrative through emotional

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
associations and symbolic meaning. Composition guides the

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
viewer's eye through your visual narrative in deliberate ways.

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We'll explore how to show rather than tell through visual

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
cues and symbolic elements. Subtext and visual metaphors

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
add layers of meaning to your illustrations. Sequential

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
storytelling principles apply even to single illustrations.

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This lesson covers narrative techniques used in children's

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
books, editorial illustration, and concept art. Learn to

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
create illustrations that tell powerful stories. Let's narrate.
