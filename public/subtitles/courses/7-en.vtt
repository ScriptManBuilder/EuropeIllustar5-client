00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Environment design creates the world where your stories unfold.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Whether you're designing fantastical landscapes or realistic

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
urban scenes, strong environment art supports your narrative.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Every environment should serve the story and enhance the mood

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
you want to convey. Research and reference gathering are

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
essential first steps in environment design. Understanding

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
how light behaves in different environments will make your

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
scenes more believable and atmospheric. Scale relationships

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
help establish the grandeur or intimacy of your environments.

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We'll explore how to create depth through atmospheric perspective

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and how to use leading lines to guide the viewer's eye.

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Texture and material representation adds realism and tactile

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
quality to your environments. Color temperature and lighting

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
scenarios create distinct moods and time-of-day effects.

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This lesson will teach you systematic approaches to environment

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
design used in games, films, and illustration industries.
